// Package scope decides whether a discovered document is within mise's law-ingest
// crawl scope — banking digital/technology regulation: IT systems & security,
// cybersecurity, data & personal-data protection, e-transactions & e-signatures,
// cloud, payments & intermediary payment, digital banking, eKYC, and the
// cross-cutting central laws that bind banks. It also reports which terms
// matched, for the ledger's discovery provenance. It is a faithful port of
// banhmi's pkg/scope matcher; the reference vocabulary (banhmi's config-schema
// seed) is embedded per jurisdiction in vocab.go.
//
// The model is two-class:
//
//   - strong terms are specific enough to put a document in scope for ANY issuer
//     (personal-data, cybersecurity, e-transaction, payment, digital-banking
//     phrases) — this is how cross-cutting laws from the National Assembly,
//     Government, or Ministry of Public Security are caught even though they are
//     not issued by the State Bank.
//   - weak terms denote technology but are common across sectors (công nghệ
//     thông tin, hệ thống thông tin, dữ liệu, chuyển đổi số …), so they count
//     only with a banking signal — an NHNN số ký hiệu or "ngân hàng" / "tổ chức
//     tín dụng" in the text — so a health-IT or e-government decree is not pulled.
//
// Field scope follows the term class: strong terms are matched against the số ký
// hiệu, title, and body text (when the feed supplies it), while weak terms are
// matched against the số ký hiệu and title only — common technology words flood
// body text and would over-match (see Match).
//
// Index-time matching (Match) is NFC-normalized and lower-cased but NEVER
// diacritic-folded: folding "an toàn" → "an toan" over-matches Vietnamese.
// Phrases are kept tight on purpose — "an toàn thông tin" (in scope) is a term,
// while bare "an toàn" (also in "tỷ lệ an toàn vốn", capital adequacy) is not.
// The ONE exception is MatchQuery (query-time only): a query typed with no
// diacritics at all is retried against diacritic-folded vocabulary so no-dấu
// users still resolve in scope. Folding is confined to fully diacritic-free
// queries and never touches Match, so corpus classification stays byte-identical.
